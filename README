This is an initial version of the codebase used for the KWT-Tiny paper. It provides a gcc-compiled executable (kwtmalloc) which takes in a pre-processed 1-second audio snippet (in_ds.c) and passes it through the KWT-Tiny model (with no special hardware instructions or acceleration).

The key orchestration of the model inference is performed in kwtmalloc.c, relying on many helper functions provided in helpers.c and the model weights in model_weights_t.c

This codebase provides an example for how a transformer model can be inferenced through custom bare metal C code without relying on libraries like PyTorch Mobile or Tensorflow Lite. Such an application is most useful where memory is constrained and/or speed is key, i.e. as in embedded systems. 

Future revisions of this repository will include the pre-processing code that is able to process any MP3 snippet into in_ds.c format, as well as the training code and PyTorch architecture of the KWT-Tiny model.
